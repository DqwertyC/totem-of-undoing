# Totem of Undoing
A minecraft datapack and resourcepack that adds a warp totem for the player's last point of death.

## Setup
Copy "UndoingDatapack" into the datapacks folder of your minecraft save. Copy "UndoingResources" into your resourcepacks folder.

## Functions
If you don't want to use the totem of undying, or you want to create your own mechanism for triggering warp to respawn, calling the function "death_utils:tp_deathpoint" as a player will warp that player to the point of their last death.

## Totem Crafting
To craft a Totem of Undoing, throw a regular Totem of Undying, two Ender Pearls, and two Echo Shards into a cauldron full of water. After a few seconds, the water will evaporate and the ingredients will have fused into your shiny new Totem of Undoing.

To use the totem, hold it in your mainhand and right click. In addition to warping the player, the totem gives the user 40 seconds of fire resistance.
